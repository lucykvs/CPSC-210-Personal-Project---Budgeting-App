# CPSC 210 Personal Project

## A budget organization app


For my CPSC 210 personal project, I will be creating a desktop application with which one can design and visualize their
financial budget. The user will have the option to either create their own **individual** budget, or utilize a cashflow
system with which a group's **cumulative** budget can be recorded. 

Many students receive loans, bursaries, and other forms of financial support, along with income from a part-time job. 
*All* spend large amounts of money on tuition, rent, textbooks, groceries, and more. I have created many complicated
Excel spreadsheets in frequent attempts to keep these costs organized, but almost always end up starting from scratch 
once it becomes unmanageable or outdated. With this project I hope to create an application that is clear, easy to use, 
and easily edited to maintain a higher level of financial organization. 

This app will be useful for: 
- students and professionals organizing their own personal budget
- small business owners aiming to keep track of startup costs
- roommates splitting costs of recurring expenses and purchases
- friends sharing costs of meals or gas


#### User Stories, Phase 1:
- As a user, I want to be able to add costs to a list of my expenses
- I want to be able to add one or multiple source(s) of income to a list of my incomes
- I want to be able to see the total of my expenses and income, and the balance of these totals
- I want to be able to see the description of my income sources in one list and my expenses in another


#### User Stories, Phase 2: 
- As a user, I want to be able to save my budget to a file
- As a user, I want to be able to reload my budget from a file in the future using my username
- As a user, when I select the quit option from the app menu, I want to be reminded to save my budget to file and have
the option to do so or not
